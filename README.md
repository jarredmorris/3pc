# Three Phase Commit implementation for a distributed multi-threaded fault-tolerant server system

# Description
An (incomplete) collection of files used to provide a full client/server system for a multi-threaded fault-tolerant distributed server system that implements the Three Phase Commit protocol to achieve consensus among nodes

Note that this collection is intentionally incomplete. It is intended to provide a snapshot of the activities I performed when creating this system. 

This source does NOT include the actual classes to represent the full part of the server system, which these files of mine "slotted into". Unfortunately this is a required step to prevent plagiarism as the university assignment that this work was created for may still be in use. Some methods have been removed or altered to return different results for the same reason. This code may not compile in this form. 

A full version of my work can be viewed at request, in person.
